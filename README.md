The Swing Tutorials


### Lesson 1: Hello World with Swing
#### Explanation
In this lesson, you will learn how to create a simple "Hello, World!" application using Java Swing. This application will create a window (JFrame) and display a label (JLabel) with the text "Hello, World!".


### Lesson 2: Understanding JFrame and JPanel
#### Explanation
In this lesson, you will learn about JFrame and JPanel, which are fundamental components in Swing. JFrame is the main window container, while JPanel is a generic container for lightweight components. We will create a simple application that uses both JFrame and JPanel.


### Lesson 3: Adding Basic Components to JPanel
#### Explanation
In this lesson, you will learn how to add basic Swing components such as buttons, labels, and text fields to a JPanel. We will create a simple form with a label, text field, and button.


### Lesson 4: Event Handling in Swing
#### Explanation
In this lesson, you will learn how to handle events in Swing. Event handling allows your application to respond to user interactions such as button clicks, text input, and other actions. We will create a simple form where clicking a button displays a message using an ActionListener.


### Lesson 5: Using Layout Managers in Swing
#### Explanation
Layout managers in Swing help you control the placement and size of components within a container. Swing provides several layout managers, such as FlowLayout, BorderLayout, GridLayout, and BoxLayout. In this lesson, we will explore these layout managers and how to use them to arrange components in a JPanel.


### Lesson 6: Creating a Complex User Interface with Nested Layout Managers
#### Explanation
In this lesson, you will learn how to create a more complex user interface by nesting multiple layout managers. Nesting layout managers allows for greater flexibility and control over the arrangement of components. We will create a simple login form with nested panels using different layout managers.


### Lesson 7: Implementing MVC Pattern in a Swing Application
#### Explanation
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. This pattern helps in organizing code and making it more maintainable. In this lesson, we will implement a simple MVC application in Swing. The application will allow the user to input two numbers and display their sum.


### Lesson 8: Connecting to a Database using JDBC
#### Explanation
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a Java API that allows you to connect and execute queries with databases. In this lesson, we will cover how to set up a JDBC connection, perform basic database operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete), and integrate these operations into a simple Swing application.
